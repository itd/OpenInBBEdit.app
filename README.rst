About Open in BBEdit
---------------------
This is a complete rip from Henrik Nyh's "Open in Textmate" gadget:
http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/10/open-in-textmate-from-leopard-finder

Thanks to Henrik for putting that handy little gadget together!

I wanted the same functionality in the OS X Finder for BBEdit
and lightly hacked Nyh's stuff to point at BBEdit. Then, hacked
a little icon together make it all nice.


installing the OpenInBBEdit gadget
-----------------------------------
Here's how I'd do it:

#. Make a ``scripts`` folder in your Applications folder
#. Download a copy (or git clone) of OpenInBBEdit.app
   and drop it in that scripts folder.
#. Drop the ``OpenInBBEdit`` app on the toolbar

Well, that's about it. You're ready to go!

If you have questions you can send me a note.
